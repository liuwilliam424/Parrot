# Parrot

**Parrot** is a classroom communication tool designed to streamline interaction between teachers and students in real time. It supplements traditional instruction with anonymous, structured messaging to encourage engagement — especially from students who might hesitate to speak up.

## What It Does

- Enables real-time, anonymous Q&A during lectures
- Allows teachers to create unique classroom codes to manage sessions
- Includes automatic spam detection and basic moderation tools

## Why It Matters

Classrooms are full of students who don’t ask questions — not because they don’t have them, but because they don’t want to raise their hands. Parrot breaks down that barrier without breaking structure.
